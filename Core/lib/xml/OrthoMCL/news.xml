OrthoMCL Version 6.1 is released. This version employs the OrthoMCL algorithm on the proteins from a carefully-chosen set of 150 Core species to form Core ortholog groups. Significantly, the website has been engineered to assign proteins from 394 other organisms, termed Peripheral organisms, into these Core groups. All peripheral proteins that fail to map to a Core group are collected and subjected to independent OrthoMCL analysis, forming Residual groups. This design will allow us to map new proteomes at every release (every 3 months).

<body>
    <p>Dear colleagues -<br>
      <br>
      We are writing to provide an update on the Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomics
      Resource (<a href="http://EuPathDB.org">EuPathDB.org</a>), which many
      hundreds of laboratories wrote to support in connection with our
      application for renewal as an NIH Bioinformatics Resource Center for
      Infectious Diseases.&nbsp; We are pleased to report that the EuPathDB
      contract has now been renewed.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to continuing to integrate the ever-increasing volume of
      Omic-scale datasets available for microbial eukaryotes, new
      functionalities anticipated over the coming months include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>full integration of FungiDB into the EuPathDB family of databases</li>
      <li>reorganization of EuPathDB record pages, so as to improve
        navigability, better accommodate curated annotation (when available),
        represent alternative transcripts, summarize functional genomic results,
        etc</li>
      <li>better representation of experimental metadata, including phenotyping
        and clinical/field results</li>
      <li>enhanced functionality of the host response database (<a href="http://HostDB.org">HostDB.org</a>)</li>
      <li>improved handling of metabolic pathways, including incorporation of
        metabolomic datasets</li>
      <li>better support for orthology-based queries and cross-species inference</li>
      <li>implementation of workspaces enabling users to upload and analyze
        their own data (e.g. RNA-seq results)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      The scope of this renewal extends beyond our previous mandate, which
      officially covered only biosecurity threats (Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba,
      Giardia, Toxoplasma, etc) and reemerging pathogens (e.g.
      Plasmodium).&nbsp; This makes it easier for us to leverage EuPathDB
      infrastructure in support of the kinetoplastida, oomycetes, fungi, and
      other microbial eukaryotes, including both pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      species.<br>
      <br>
      The scale of the EuPathDB award from NIH does not provide adequate funding
      for full support of the TriTrypDB or FungiDB projects (unfortunately) ...
      but the Wellcome Trust has agreed to consider an application covering
      these initiatives, augmenting our existing award for kinetoplastid
      resources.&nbsp; We will be contacting users of these databases shortly
      for their support.<br>
      <br>
      As always, we look forward to feedback from database users, via the
      'Contact Us' link on all EuPathDB web sites, face-to-face discussions at
      major meetings, etc.<br>

OrthoMCL-DB Version 5-WDK (Beta) is released.  It uses the new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/strategies-wdk/">Strategies-WDK</a> based web site.  Version 6 is on the way in the first half of 2013.  It will be the first build using a new backend system that will help us get releases out at a faster rate.

OrthoMCL-DB Version 3 is released.  The new dataset includes 128 genomes.  New web site features include: (1) a tool to assign your proteins to OrthoMCL groups (see the new tools menu);  (2) a mapping from Version 3 groups to Version 2 and 1 is available for searching, allowing you to track changes across versions;  (3) the phyletic pattern in the groups result page is configurable, so you can tailor it to the clades you are interested in.

OrthoMCL-DB Version 2 is released.  The new dataset includes an increased number of genomes (87).  New features on the web site include a system wide speed up; a significant speed up of the phyletic pattern query; improvements in query pages and group pages to accomodate the increased number of genomes; and use of public identifiers for sequences throughout the site, instead of assigned identifiers.  Perhaps most importantly, the production of the dataset has been moved to a pipeline system.  This will allow us to generate new versions at a much improved frequency.
